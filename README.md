My main goal for this application was to create a password generator that takes user-inputted specifications and outputs a password onto their screen accordingly. The password can be anywhere from 8 to 128 characters long and can contain any or no mixture of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. If they attempt to generate a password without checking any boxes, they'll be met with a Bootstrap alert until they check at least one box and click the Generate button again. Once the user gets their password, they can click a button to copy it onto their clipboard, or they can click the Generate button again and get a different password.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript heavily throughout this process. Although quite simple and minimalistic, this feels like my first true web application and it definitely pushed me to my limits as a new developer. I spent many hours ensuring that this password generator is responsive, polished, easy to use, and essentially failproof (I think).
